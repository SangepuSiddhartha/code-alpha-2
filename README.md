Chatbot Code with SpaCy
First, let's create a chatbot using SpaCy. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:
### 1. Install Required Libraries
First, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install NLTK using pip:pip install nltk
2. Create Your Python Script
Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and create a new Python file, e.g., chatbot.py.
4. Run Your Chatbot
In VS Code, open a terminal and run your Python script:python chatbot.py
Explanation of the Code:
Imports: We import the necessary modules from NLTK.
FAQ Pairs: We define a list of tuples where each tuple contains a pattern (regular expression) and a response.
Chatbot Instance: We create an instance of the Chat class from NLTK with our FAQ pairs and reflections (which help handle variations in user input).
Function to Get Response: chatbot_response function takes user input and returns the chatbot's response.
Main Function: This function handles user interaction. It continuously prompts the user for input and provides responses until the user types 'quit'.
Notes:
Customization: You can customize the faq_pairs list with more questions and answers specific to your needs.
Complexity: This is a basic implementation. For more complex scenarios, consider using more advanced NLP techniques or libraries such as SpaCy or transformers from Hugging Face.

### Notes

- **Customization**: Feel free to modify the patterns and responses in the code to fit your specific use case.
- **Complexity**: This example is basic. For more advanced features, consider integrating more sophisticated NLP techniques or external APIs.

With this setup, you should have a functional FAQ chatbot and a well-documented GitHub repository for others to use and contribute to.
